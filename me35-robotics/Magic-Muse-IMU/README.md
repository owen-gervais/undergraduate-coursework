# Magic Muse
This project used an Arduino Nano with a built-in IMU in order to capture swipe gesture data to play the C major scale. 

## ```main.py ```
This is the main 
**micropython**
for the EV3 for the Magic Muse project. It reads the **Arduino IMU** data through **Serial** in order to register and play correct pitches with the swipe of the wand. 

## ```main.ino ```
This is the main 
**arduino sketch**
for the Nano IOT 33 BLE so that it can publish the onboard **IMU** data to the EV3
