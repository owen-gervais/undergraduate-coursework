## ```Better Sorter```
This project utilized **Tensorflow** running in **Labview** to sort LEGOs into cups by use of a previously trained model.

## ```Five-Bar-Planar-Robot```
This was the final project for Introduction for Robotics. I made a five-bar planar robot using the EV3 LEGO Robotics Kit. In this repository you will be able to find the two main programs for the system to run.

## ```Haptic-Feedback-XYplotter```

This project utilized haptic feedback in order for the controller to detect a letter. We utilized a joystick controlled xy plotter to accomplish this goal. The system worked by 
sending haptic feedback signals over UART between two EV3 bricks.

## ```Hungry-Hippos-Bucket-Grabber```

This is the codebase for the bucket launcher allowing for drive control using the Systemlink dashboards and API


## ```Magic Muse```
This project used an Arduino Nano with a built-in IMU in order to capture swipe gesture data to play the C major scale. 

## ```Oxidizer```

This project utilized photoresitors to detect intensity of light and send to the EV3 for processing and correction. This whole process was **PID** tuned. 

## ```Projectile-Motion-Midterm```
This project tasked us to make a ball launcher that used two different methods to accurately target a cup. 

## ```Red-LEGO-Sorter```
This project utilized **OpenCV** running on a Raspberry Pi Zero detecting RED legos and sending the data over Serial to the EV3.
