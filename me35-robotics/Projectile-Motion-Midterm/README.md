# Projectile-Motion-Midterm
This project tasked us to make a ball launcher that used two different methods to accurately target a cup. 

## ```main.py ```
This is the main 
**micropython**
for the EV3 for the Midterm Project. It calculates the amount of force necessary to hit a ball into a cup based on the user selected mode. The user can choose between Newton or AI models.
