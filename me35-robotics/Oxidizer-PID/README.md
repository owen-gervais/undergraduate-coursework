# Oxidizer

This project utilized photoresitors to detect intensity of light and send to the EV3 for processing and correction. This whole process was **PID** tuned. 

## ```main.py```

This is the main code for operation. It reads in the light intensity from two photoresistors, compares, and corrects in order to follow a line. The PID control is implemented here.
