# Better Sorter
This project utilized **Tensorflow** running in **Labview** to sort LEGOs into cups by use of a previously trained model.

## ```main.py```
This is the **micropython** codebase for the Better-Sorter project, which grabbed the result of a Tensorflow object recognition generated in Labview from Systemlink Cloud.
