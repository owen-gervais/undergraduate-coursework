# Five-Bar-Planar-Robot
This was the final project for Introduction for Robotics. I made a five-bar planar robot using the EV3 LEGO Robotics Kit. In this repository you will be able to find the two main programs for the system to run.

## ```main.py ```
This is the main 
**micropython**
for the EV3 for the Final Project. It calculates the inverse kinematics of the five-bar planar robot and then pulls data from systemlink to make sure that the ball is in zone to be grabbed by the end effector.

## ```modelPreload.py ```
This is the main 
**tensorFlow**
code for the image recogntition portion of robot.
